## üöÄ Project Goals
- Analyze IPL 2024 data using advanced graph and network analytics.
- Construct a complex network with:
  - **Nodes:** Representing players, teams, and matches.
  - **Edges:** Capturing interactions like runs scored, wickets taken, and match outcomes.
- Identify key players, influential teams, and critical match outcomes.
- Develop predictive models to forecast player performance and categorize playing styles.
- Provide visual insights into player and team performances.
